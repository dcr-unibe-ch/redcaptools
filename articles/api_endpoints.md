# REDCap API endpoints

``` r

library(redcaptools)
```

REDCap has a long list of API endpoints (types of information) that can
be extracted. Here we list the most important ones (in our opinion), and
give an indication of how to access them via `redcaptools`.

`redcap_export_tbl` is the real workhorse of `redcaptools`. It is the
primary interface to the API. Other export functions all wrap this in
some form.

### Records

The most important is arguably the `record` endpoint, which allows you
to download the actual data.

``` r

redcap_export_tbl(token, url, "record")
```

### Data dictionary (Metadata)

Without the data dictionary, it’s often difficult to tell what a
variable is.

``` r

redcap_export_tbl(token, url, "metadata")
```

This is one of the three pieces of metadata downloaded by default by the
`redcap_export_meta` function.

``` r

redcap_export_meta(token, url)$metadata
```

The data dictionary is also really important for the functions which
format and label variables (e.g. `redcap_prep`, `singlechoice_ops`,
`singlechoice_factor` and co)

### Instruments

The list of eCRFs (known as instruments in REDCap). This provides a link
between the data dictionary and the instrument labels as seen in REDCap.

``` r

redcap_export_tbl(token, url, "instrument")
```

### Events

The list of events (visits)

``` r

redcap_export_tbl(token, url, "event")
```

This is one of the three pieces of metadata downloaded by the
`redcap_export_meta` function.

``` r

redcap_export_meta(token, url)$event
```

### Form-event mapping

This endpoint lists which forms are available in which events/visits.

``` r

redcap_export_tbl(token, url, "formEventMapping")
```

This is one of the three pieces of metadata downloaded by the
`redcap_export_meta` function.

``` r

redcap_export_meta(token, url)$formEventMapping
```

### Repeating forms and events

This is of use when repeated forms and/or events are used.

``` r

redcap_export_tbl(token, url, "repeatingFormsEvents")
```

### Arms

Arms allow different groups of participants (records) to have different
visit structures. In the export, they are visible in the
`redcap_event_name` variable as e.g. `form_name_arm_1`. The `arm` API
endpoint allows one to retrieve the labels for the arms.

``` r

redcap_export_tbl(token, url, "arm")
```

### Export List of Export Field Names

This endpoint lists the variable names as they are exported from REDCap.
It matches the data dictionary, except for the case of multiple choice
variables which are exported as x\_**1, x**\_2, etc.

``` r

redcap_export_tbl(token, url, "exportFieldNames")
```
