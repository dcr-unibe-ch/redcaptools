# REDCap Recode

This function loops through all the variables of a data set and compares
them with the field type and validation of the variables as set up in
REDCap.  
The REDCap data dictionary can either be directly provided or downloaded
from the REDCap project by providing an API token and matching URL.  
Variables can be converted automatically or manually to match the type
and validation in REDCap.  
The script will then summarize all values that do not match the expected
format and will look for values that could potentially indicate missing
values (such as 'missing', 'excluded',...).  
In a second step, these values can be recoded automatically or manually
if missing data codes have defined in REDCap Additional Customizations
(or simply set to NA).  
If a variable has been converted to a factor (e.g., radio button field),
the recoding is (additionally) prompted for all factor levels.  
The function returns a data frame with the recoded variables, writes an
overview csv-table, and the executed code to a txt-file for copy-pasting
and adjusting/reusing.  
It is advised to use `redcap_import_select` on the data first, before
running this function.

## Usage

``` r
redcap_import_recode(
  input_data,
  dict = NULL,
  missing_codes = NULL,
  rc_token,
  rc_url,
  start_var = 1,
  pot_miss = c("miss", "unknown", "excluded", "^0$", "NA", "N.A."),
  if_empty = NA,
  cb_delims = c(",", " ", ".", ";", "|"),
  auto_conv = TRUE,
  auto_recode = FALSE,
  auto_recode_precision = 0.5,
  skip_intro = FALSE,
  continue = TRUE,
  suppress_txt = FALSE,
  log = TRUE,
  log_code = "redcap_import_recode_code.txt",
  log_table = "redcap_import_recode_overview.csv",
  wait = 2,
  ...
)
```

## Arguments

- input_data:

  Data to be recoded

- dict:

  Data dictionary (e.g. as downloaded from REDCap or via
  `redcap_export_meta(rc_token, rc_url)$meta`). If not supplied, this
  will be downloaded from the API using `rc_token` and `rc_token`.

- missing_codes:

  If a data dictionary is provided by the user, Missing Data Codes as
  defined in REDCap Additional Customizations can be provided here (if
  set up accordingly). The Missing Data Codes should be provided in a
  single string with \[code\] \[label\] separated by a comma and a pipe
  between the options (e.g., "-99, Missing \| EXCL, Excluded \| NA, not
  available"). If no data dictionary is provided, the codes will be
  downloaded from the API using `rc_token` and `rc_token` (if set up
  accordingly).

- rc_token:

  REDCap API token

- rc_url:

  Link to REDCap API

- start_var:

  Define in which column of the data the loop should start. Default = 1.

- pot_miss:

  The provided data is inspected for potential missing values that could
  be recoded. This is mainly helpful for text variables. Expressions can
  simply be defined in a character vector and a text-search is applied
  to search through the data. Default =
  c("miss","unknown","excluded","^0\$","NA","N.A."). To disable this
  search set pot_miss to NULL.

- if_empty:

  Sets a default value for empty cells. This value can be changed for
  each variable when using manual recoding. Default = NA (meaning the
  cell remains empty).

- cb_delims:

  Character vector to specify the delimiter(s) to separate values for
  checkbox fields in a single cell. Default = c(","," ",".",";","\|")

- auto_conv:

  If TRUE, the variable will be auto-converted according to the best
  matching field type and validation in REDCap. If FALSE, the user can
  decide how the variable should be converted. If the option to continue
  is active (see below), this auto-conversion can be switched on and off
  while running the script. Default = TRUE.

- auto_recode:

  If TRUE, the values that need recoding will be auto-recoded by
  matching them with codes and labels as set up in REDCap. If FALSE, the
  user can decide to recode the values as suggested or to recode each
  value individually. Default = FALSE.

- auto_recode_precision:

  The values that need recoding are compared with codes and labels as
  set up in REDCap. With this numeric similarity index between 0 (no
  similarity at all = shows basically all code/labels as similar) and 1
  (identical = shows only perfect codes/labels) the number of
  suggestions can be adjusted. If auto-recoding is switched off, this
  index can be adjusted while running the script. If multiple matches
  are found, the value will be set to NA. Default = 0.5.

- skip_intro:

  If TRUE, the introduction messages will be skipped. Default = FALSE

- continue:

  If TRUE, a question to continue will be asked before moving along the
  loop. Default = TRUE.

- suppress_txt:

  If TRUE, all text output will be suppressed when used with
  auto-conversion and auto-recoding. This is not recommended and should
  only be used for testing. Default = FALSE.

- log:

  If TRUE, an overview csv-table, and a txt-file are stored in the
  working directory. Default = TRUE.

- log_code:

  Name and location of the txt-file containing the executed code.
  Default = redcap_import_recode_code.txt.

- log_table:

  Name and location of the csv.table containing the tabular overview.
  Default = redcap_import_recode_overview.csv.

- wait:

  Allows you to set the latency time between the steps. Default = 2s.

- ...:

  other parameters used for `redcap_import_dates` or
  `redcap_import_times`

## Value

Data frame with recoded data. Log-file with executed code.

## Examples

``` r
# data(importdemo_data)
# data(importdemo_dict)
# redcap_import_recode(importdemo_data, importdemo_dict)

# if using local data:
# token <- "xxxxx"
# url <- "xxxxx"
# file <- "data.csv"
# redcap_import_recode(file, rc_token = token, rc_url = url)
```
